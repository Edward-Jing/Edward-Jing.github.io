I received a B.S. degree in statistics from [Fudan University Department of Statistics and Data science ](https://www.fdsm.fudan.edu.cn/en/Statistics.aspx) in 2022. My thesis (Dota2 Mid-line AI based on Deep Reinforcement Learning) was fortunate to be advised by [Prof.Yin Xia](https://www.fdsm.fudan.edu.cn/En/preview.html?UID=012108) . Prior to this, I participated in UCEAP [(University of California Education Abroad Program)](https://uceap.universityofcalifornia.edu/) in 2019 Fall and exchanged in UC Davis.

I am  interested in statistical problems of learning large complex biological data, with the method of casual inference, high-demension methods and statistical learning.
